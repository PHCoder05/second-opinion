### Medical App Design System JSON Profile

Based on common practices in mobile UI design for healthcare applications, I've created a JSON profile that captures a generalized design system. This JSON extracts and abstracts visual and structural elements from typical doctor appointment app screenshots, focusing on styles, components, layouts, and guidelines. It avoids any specific image content and is structured to help an AI (like Cursor) replicate consistent designs. The design emphasizes minimalism, accessibility, and user-friendly navigation suitable for medical contexts.

The JSON includes:

- **Design Style**: Color palettes, typography, spacing, and themes inspired by healthcare UI best practices (e.g., calming colors, high contrast for readability).
- **Structure**: Layout hierarchies, component definitions, and reusable patterns for screens like home, profiles, and scheduling.
- **Replication Aids**: Tokens for design elements, responsive rules, and accessibility guidelines to ensure consistency across platforms.

You can copy this JSON directly into tools like Cursor for generating or iterating on similar designs.
